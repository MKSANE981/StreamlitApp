# StreamlitApp
This is an app that was created in the frame of our Machine Learning course with Mrs Mously

Follow these instructions to know how to use the app :

This app give two opportunities :
- Store datasets and merge them by a common column "Chargement et fusion de base"
- Create a dashboard with a dataset uploaded. Bear in mind that for this second point, it is customized with the data used during the course "fusion_fusion_clics_impressions_achats.csv". All the functionnalities of the Data visualization DashBoard are set with the columns of the datasets.
