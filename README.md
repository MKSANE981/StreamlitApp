# StreamlitApp
This is an app that was created in the frame of our Machine Learning course with Mrs Mously

Follow these instructions to know how to use the app :

This app give two opportunities :
- Store datasets and merge them by a common column "Chargement et fusion de base"
- Create a dashboard with a dataset uploaded. Bear in mind that for this second point, it is customized with the data used during the course "fusion_fusion_clics_impressions_achats.csv". All the functionnalities of the Data visualization DashBoard are set with the columns of the datasets.

Merge the data :
- Upload the data ("achats.csv", "impressions.csv" and "clics.csv")
- On the sidebar, there are options objects for whether the visualisation of the data uploaded or to merge two datasets (Know that the merging is by two datsets).
- After each merging, you will have to upload the file created.

Dashboard visualization
- Upload the final dataset
- you can check the checkbox to see the data
- Choose all the useful variables (all excepted Unnamed) for the visualization (for the date variable, choose "timestamp_x")
- Check "Conversion de la variable date"
- And last you can make filters to see the statistics on the graphs.
